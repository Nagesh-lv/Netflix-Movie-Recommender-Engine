# Netflix-Movie-Recommender-Engine
### Project Overview
In this project, the goal is to create a Movie Recommendation Engine from the ground up. The system will recommend movies to users based on their area of interest (genres) and their ratings. The recommendation engine will aim to suggest movies that are best suited to individual users by analyzing past interactions, ratings, and preferences. Additionally, the project will provide insights into movie genres and their popularity based on user feedback.

#### Problem Statement
Recommendation systems are crucial in helping users discover relevant content based on their preferences. This project will focus on building a movie recommendation engine that takes into account user ratings and genre preferences.
    
#### Dataset Information
The dataset contains various features related to users, movies, and their ratings. Here are the key attributes:
ID: Contains unique identifiers for both users and movies.
Rating: The ratings provided by users for different movies (typically on a scale of 1-5).
Genre: The category or genre of the movie (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy).
Movie Name: The name of the movie corresponding to the movie ID.
This data will be used to build a recommendation engine that identifies the best movies for users based on their preferences and past behavior.

#### Objectives
1. Popular and Liked Genres
Task: Analyze the dataset to identify the most popular and well-rated genres.
Deliverable: A list of genres that are frequently rated highly by users, providing insights into general preferences.
2. Movie Recommendation Model
Task: Build a recommendation model that can suggest movies for users based on their ratings and genre preferences. This will involve collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models.
Deliverable: A recommendation engine that outputs a list of movies tailored to a userâ€™s interests across different genres.
3. Genre Ratings Analysis
Task: Evaluate which genres have received the best and worst ratings from users.
Deliverable: A report highlighting the best and worst-performing genres based on user feedback, providing insights into genre trends.

#### Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset, handling missing values, and formatting data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing an analysis to discover user behavior patterns, genre preferences, and rating distributions.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that can enhance the recommendation model, such as genre-based user preferences, or movie metadata.
Recommendation Model: Building and tuning the recommendation engine using one or more of the following approaches:
Collaborative Filtering: Recommending movies based on similar users or items.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommending movies based on the characteristics of the movies themselves (e.g., genre).
Hybrid Models: Combining collaborative and content-based filtering for more accurate recommendations.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the recommendation model using metrics such as precision, recall, and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
Genre Insights: Generating reports on the most popular, best-rated, and worst-rated genres.

#### Tools & Technologies
Python: Main language used for data analysis and building the recommendation system.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations to explore rating trends and genre popularity.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Surprise Library: For implementing collaborative filtering algorithms.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and model development
